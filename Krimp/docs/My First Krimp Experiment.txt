================== Getting started with Krimp ======================


=== 0. Configure Krimp on your system ===

- Modify datadir.conf such that the [dataDir] and [expDir] directives point to your data 
resp. experiment output directories. Please note that these should always be full paths,
not relative!
- On a 32-bits x86 Windows system, try running bin\krimp.exe (or bin\krimp_x86.exe). If 
it raises an error or terminates without any message, you may have to install the Microsoft 
Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package.
The x86 version is available for download here:
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8328
- On a 64-bits x64 Windows system, bin\krimp_x64.exe should also work. If it gives an error 
or terminates without any message, you may have to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 
SP1 Redistributable Package.
The x64 version is available for download here:
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=13523
- On a Linux system, try running bin\krimp. If it does not work, compile your own executable
using the included source (see README).


=== 1. Prepare your database ===

- Databases can be in either [dataDir] or [dataDir]\datasets.
- Krimp accepts currently only item data. For now, items should be positive integers.
- Krimp has its own database file format. Files in this format generally end with .db. See
the datasets directory for some example databases (mostly from the UCI repository).
- Use convertdb.conf to convert your own database to the correct format. The data should be
formatted as the example databases chess.dat and mushroom.dat (in the datasets directory).
Each row is a transaction, each number is an item that is present in that particular 
transaction. Modify convertdb.conf to suit your needs and run it from the command line or
drag-an-drop the config file onto krimp.exe. Commandline:

	C:\Krimp\bin> krimp convertdb

- Use analysedb.conf to get some basic statistics about your database, if you like.
The analysis textfile also gives you the translation from the original item numbers to
the numbers as used in the converted database. (Left column: [after]=>[before])


=== 2. Find those itemsets that matter ===

- Open up compress.conf.
- The most important configuration directives are:
	* iscName = chess-all-2500d
	This directive tells Krimp which candidates are to be used. Also, the database name is 
	extracted from this directive is not given separately (which is the easiest way to go).

	Format: [dbName]-[itemsetType]-[minSup][candidateOrder]
	
	dbName			- chess, mushroom, ...
	itemsetType		- all, closed
	minSup			- absolute minimum support level
	candidateOrder	- the standard order as described in our papers is 'd'
	
	The program first looks for existing item set collection files. If the correct file does
	not exist, candidates are automatically mined. Whether this file is kept after compression
	is determined by the following directive:
	
	* iscIfMined = zap
	zap				- Do not keep file if created for this compression run.
	store			- Store file in [dataDir]\candidates if created for this 
						compression run.
	
	* pruneStrategy = nop
	Determine whether on-the-fly code table pruning has to be applied or not. nop means no
	pruning, pop means post-pruning which is the regular pruning method we described in our
	paper.


=== 3. Inspect your results ===

- Compression results are stored in Krimp\xps\compress. Each run gets its own directory,
based on configuration and a timestamp.
- In such a directory, you'll find (amongst some unimportant files):
	* compress-[timestamp].conf
		The configuration you used to run this particular experiment.
	* ct-[candidateSet]-[pruneStrategy]-[timestamp]-[support]-[candNum].ct
		The code table at support level [support], which was outputted after processing
		[candNum] candidate item sets.
		In such a file, you'll find the complete code table. Except for the first two 
		rows (which make up a header, with info on the number of code table elements and
		the number of singleton item sets), each row is a code table element. The pattern
		is represented by the space-separated items. Between brackets is some meta info:
		first the current count of this particular pattern in the cover, second the total
		number of occurences of this pattern in the original database.
	* report-[candidateSet]-[pruneStrategy]-[timestamp].csv
		A full report, summarizing what happened during the run. Comma-separated data, so
		open with Excel or something like that. You'll find the following columns:
			minSup		- Support level reported on.
			numCands	- Number of candidates processed so far.
			numAlphUsed 	- Number of singleton item sets required in the cover.
			numSetsUsed 	- Number of non-singleton code table elements with non-zero count.
			numSets		- Number of non-singleton code table elements.
							(Always equal to numSetsUsed when pruning is enabled.)
			countSum	- Total number of times a code table element is used in the cover.
							(Used to determine code lengths.)
			dbSize		- Encoded database size, in bits. (Without code table!)
			ctSize		- Code table size, in bits.
			totalSize	- dbSize + ctSize, in bits.
			seconds		- Number of seconds it took to reach this point.

- Enjoy! :)
