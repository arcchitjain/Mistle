# GANAK- A Probabilistic Exact Model Counter
GANAK  takes in a CNF formula `F` and a confidence `delta` as input and returns `count` such that `count` is the number of solutions of `F` with confidence at least `1 - delta`. GANAK supports projected model counting (see below). 

To read more about technical algorithms in Ganak, please refer to [our paper](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~meel/Papers/ijcai19srsm.pdf) 

#### New: Support Added for Weighted Model Counting: Please checkout to wmc branch.

## Installation

### Compiling in Linux

build MIS from [here](https://github.com/meelgroup/mis) and add `mis.py`, `muser2` and `togmus` to `build` directory.

To build ganak, issue:

```
bash
sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev
sudo apt-get install libmpfr-dev
sudo apt-get install libmpc-dev
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```


## Usage
You can run GANAK by using 'ganak.py' Python script. A simple invocation looks as follows:
```bash
python3 ../bin/ganak.py <cnffile>
```

The usage instructions and default values to arguments can be found by running:
```bash
python3 ../bin/ganak.py -h
```
### Projected Model Counting
For some applications, one is not interested in solutions over all the variables and instead interested in counting the number of unique solutions to a subset of variables, called sampling set. GANAK allows you to specify the sampling set using the following modified version of DIMACS format:

```
$ cat myfile.cnf
c ind 1 3 4 6 7 8 10 0
p cnf 500 1
3 4 0
```
Above, using the `c ind` line, we declare that only variables 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10 form part of the sampling set out of the CNF's 500 variables `1,2...500`. This line must end with a 0. The solution that GANAK will be giving is essentially answering the question: how many different combination of settings to this variables are there that satisfy this problem? Naturally, if your sampling set only contains 7 variables, then the maximum number of solutions can only be at most 2^7 = 128. This is true even if your CNF has thousands of variables.

## Benchmarks
Few toy benchmarks are given in benchmarks directory. Full list of benchmarks used for our experiments is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15dUJI55drFH_0-4-qWjoF_YR0amb3xnK/view?usp=sharing)
